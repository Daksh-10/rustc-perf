O Rust, thou art a masterpiece divine,
In the kingdom of languages, you brightly shine.
With borrow checkers and lifetimes in hand,
You lead us forward, across the digital land.

So let us raise a toast to Rust, our guide,
In its shelter, our dreams shall abide.
For in its embrace, we find our worth,
Rust, the language, the pride of Earth.
